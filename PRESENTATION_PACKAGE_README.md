## ❓ HANDLING COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Why Python instead of Java?"
**Answer**: "Python is #1 for automation, 3x less code, easier hiring pool. Team Alpha proves it works."

### "What's the migration effort?"
**Answer**: "2-3 days per team. Can run in parallel with old framework. Zero disruption."

### "What if the team doesn't like it?"
**Answer**: "Team Alpha loves it. We have 8 comprehensive guides and 2-hour training sessions ready."

### "Is Playwright production-ready?"
**Answer**: "Microsoft-backed, growing 50%/year, used by Netflix and Airbnb. More stable than Selenium."

### "How can you guarantee $78K savings?"
**Answer**: "Conservative estimates from Team Alpha actual data. Happy to show the detailed breakdown."

### "What happens if we don't proceed?"
**Answer**: "We keep the slow, expensive old framework and miss $78K annual savings. Every month we wait costs $6,500."
