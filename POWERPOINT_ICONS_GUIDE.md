## 🎭 PLAYWRIGHT ICON

### **Official Playwright Logo**

**⭐ BEST OPTION: Download Official Logo (RECOMMENDED)**

The actual Playwright logo is a distinctive green geometric design with triangular play shapes. **Emojis don't match it well.**

**Where to get official logo**:
1. **Direct SVG download**: https://playwright.dev/img/playwright-logo.svg
2. **Official site**: https://playwright.dev/ (right-click logo → Save image)
3. **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright

**How to insert in PowerPoint**:
1. Download the SVG or PNG from above
2. PowerPoint → Insert → Pictures → This Device
3. Select downloaded file
4. Resize as needed (recommend 64-72pt height)

**Official Playwright Colors**:
- Primary Green: `#2EAD33`
- Dark Green: `#1A8A25`
- Background: White or transparent

---

**Option 2: Create Simple Playwright-Style Icon in PPT (5 minutes)**

**Instructions**:

**Visual approximation**:
```
▶▶  (two triangles pointing right)
```

---

**Option 3: Text-Based Placeholder (Quick but not accurate)**
```
▶|◀
```
**Copy this**: ▶|◀

- **Note**: This doesn't match the actual logo, use only as temporary placeholder

```
🎭
```
The theater masks emoji (🎭) is **NOT** similar to the actual Playwright logo and should be avoided.
